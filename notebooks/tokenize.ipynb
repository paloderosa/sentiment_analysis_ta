If you closed the shutters however, the room was very dark. Maybe the rooms upstairs are better. The bed sheets were old and looked worn and they did not fit the double mattresses.

More importantly, during my stay, I began to suffer from the Zika Virus. While the hostel was of no fault there, what was concerning to me was that I was in bed for several days, moaning and looking dreadful, while the staff walked past, unconcerned.

Ours had six, crammed into a very small space. - Some of the toilets/showers are in outside cubicles.

However, this hotel was not only more expensive than another hotel we stayed at in Antigua a few days earlier (literally twice the cost), but they required a two night minimum and the room was of far poorer quality than the first hotel.    Here are a few details of our stay: -Our quad 'deluxe' room (a higher price than the regular quad which we selected because of availability) did not have any outside-facing windows and was poorly lit. -The glass on the windows that faced the hallway were broken, allowing for anyone to reach in and open the window\",\n",

The rate was quite a bit more than several other hotels which offer nicer rooms. I can't recommend this hotel!\",\n",

The walls do not have the best sound proof, the room is quite small and the bed was hard like concrete. As we couls note close one of are windows, because the glass was missing - a rooftop party a couple of blocks kept us awake until 2am, which is pretty anoying after a long day.

We made lots of noise and knocked on the desk a couple of times because in reality there should always be someone present at the desk considering the hotel locks the doors at night and the only way youre getting in is if a worker lets you in.

The ‘pub crawl’ starts at 4pm at the hostel and within an hour the place is like a zoo (I.e imagine monkeys throwing faeces). They pack you in like sardines (triple bunks).

Additionally, and with the exception of the nasty Casa Santo Domingo, virtually everyone in Antigua strives to make visitors happy with over the top service. This alone makes it hard to criticize Antigua hotels largely because you don't want an unjaundiced review to reflect badly on waiters, hotel staff and others who have worked hard to make your stay enjoyable.

There was an ok amount of space, although there was nowhere to put luggage (our bags either blocked the door to the courtyard or to the bathroom hallway).

Down side a hotel this size is that when something goes wrong (e.g. car never arrived), there is no accountability and it is the customer who needs to find a solution with no help from the front desk (I had to go and find another car in the very last minute, arriving very late to my meeting).  - CHECK OUT WAS A PIN.

To me, an awful bed kills it for me. But the $20 massages made me feel better about my choice. Not sure if I'd come back because my back can't handle it.

If you closed the shutters however, the room was very dark. Maybe the rooms upstairs are better. The bed sheets were old and looked worn and they did not fit the double mattresses.

The shared bathroom was ok, and worked for showering and using the restroom. I loved the roof-top view and the hammocks. The location is very close to almost everything in Antigua, and walking to and from the center of town was a breeze. I'd say the stay was safe. The only downfall was the noisy patrons coming in late at night and we could hear people playing music on a rooftop for hours late into the night. Bring your shower shoes, because the shower is more of an industrial type. Value for the price? Excellent. If you are looking for a hostel environment, this is a great place to stay!\",\n",

The garden, swiming pool and saloon are also minimal.  The breakfast is 'a la carte' and it is correct.  In short, it is not worth the price it costs at all.
